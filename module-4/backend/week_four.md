  Waffle
2. Why do we create staging environments?
  We create them to test code in a near production like environment.

  Well documented, attention grabbing, use cases.

  Use alt tags more often.

  being passed in in a way that could give them access to sensitive data.

  It keeps a working main branch and seperates features into small, manageable
  pieces of code that can easily be reviewed.

  Pros: Stable, convenient, user friendly
  Cons: High pace of development, poor documentation

#### Review
